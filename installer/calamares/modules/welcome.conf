    # Only RAM is a hard requirement. Storage and root are checked
    # but shown as non-blocking warnings — the live ISO environment
    # often misreports available storage (unmounted/unformatted drives)
    # and root status depends on the session launcher chain.
    # The partition module validates actual drive availability later.
